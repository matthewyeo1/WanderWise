# Wanderwise
NUS Orbital 2024  
Proposed level of achievement: Apollo 11

### Motivation
As NUS students who love to travel around the world, we often find ourselves unable to find time amidst our hectic school schedule to plan for overseas trips as a form of relaxation during the summer and winter breaks. As such, we want to make a travel planning app called WanderWise that will make trip-planning simple, quick and convenient for people who are too busy to do it.  


### Aim
To develop a mobile app (WanderWise) that makes travel planning convenient for both new and seasoned travellers so that they are able to find value-for-money accommodation options and attractions, manage their travel expenses and bookings and most importantly, enjoy their trip to the fullest.  

### User Stories
1. As someone who travels for business, I want to find flights and hotels quickly amidst my hectic work schedule.   
2. As someone who travels for vacation with my family, I want to be able to plan a travel itinerary without much hassle while I juggle with work and familial commitments.  
3. As someone who backpacks for travel, I want to find affordable accommodation to stay as well as exciting and worthwhile attractions to visit near the places I am staying at or travelling to.  
4. As a student preparing to plan an overseas trip, I want to be able to plan for the trip in the most time-efficient way so that I can focus on my studies in the meantime.   
5. As a prudent spender, I want to be able to find attractions and accommodations within my budget when I travel abroad.   
6. As someone who loves travelling, I want to be able to have all my travel details all in one app.

### Scope of project
WanderWise is a travel planning app that helps to ease the logistical burdens of pre-travel planning for users by ensuring all essential tasks can be done in the app.  

The app provides users with an empty itinerary for users to customise. Additionally, users are able to use OpenAI for generating itineraries and input their date and duration of travel, budget, and intention of travel, and from there, the app will recommend activities to be added into the itinerary. Furthermore, the app allows the user to upload important documents pertaining to their flight and hotel information all within the app, ensuring that all essential tasks are completed and not forgotten.
